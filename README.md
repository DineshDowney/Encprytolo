# Encprytolo
This is a mini project.
It uses tables to Encrypt a user given string. Which can be decrypted later on with the Key which will be generated each session.
User will have to save the Key for future Decryption.

## To-Do
[ ] The frontend of the current Django framework is extremely basic, and will be updated and pushed soon.
