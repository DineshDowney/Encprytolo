# Encprytolo
This is a mini project.
It uses cryptography library to Encrypt a user given string. Which can be decrypted later on with the Key which will be generated each session.
### User will have to input his E-mail Address to receive the Key and the Encrypted Text for future Decryption.

## To-Do
[ ] The frontend of the current Django framework is pretty basic, and will be updated and pushed soon.
